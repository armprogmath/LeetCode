1.Streams & Buffers — short answer

  “A Buffer in Node.js is a raw binary data container stored outside the V8 heap.
  It allows Node to efficiently handle bytes—files, network packets, images, etc.
  Streams are an abstraction that process data piece-by-piece instead of loading everything into memory.
  They support backpressure and come in four types: Readable, Writable, Duplex, and Transform.
  Using streams with buffers lets Node handle large files, network traffic,
  and real-time data efficiently without blocking the event loop.”

  2.Memory Leak Causes — short answer

    “Memory leaks in Node.js usually happen when objects stay referenced longer than needed.
    The most common causes are: keeping large data in global variables, long-living caches without eviction (Redis or in-memory),
    not removing event listeners, forgotten timers/intervals, unbounded arrays or Maps, closures holding references,
    and not handling streams/backpressure causing buffers to grow. In production I monitor heap usage,
    event-loop lag, and use tools like clinic, heap snapshots, and —inspect to detect leaks.”

  ===========================================================================

  3.Performance Optimization — short answer

    “For performance optimization in Node.js, I focus on keeping the event loop free: avoid blocking operations,
    offload CPU-heavy tasks to worker threads or queues, and use streaming instead of loading large data in memory.
    I optimize database queries with proper indexing, caching strategies (Redis), pagination, and connection pooling.
    I also use horizontal scaling, clustering, load balancing, and proper backpressure handling.
    In production, I monitor event-loop delay, CPU, memory, slow queries,
    and use profiling tools like Clinic and flamegraphs to find bottlenecks.”

  ===========================================================================

  4.Cluster Mode — short answer

    “Cluster mode in Node.js allows you to take advantage of multi-core CPUs by creating multiple worker processes
    that share the same server port.
    Each worker runs its own event loop and memory space, so CPU-bound tasks can be distributed across cores.
    The master process manages the workers, restarts them if they crash, and can balance load.
    This is important because Node’s single-threaded event loop cannot fully utilize multiple CPU cores on its own.”

  ===========================================================================

  5.Async Patterns — short answer

    “Node.js supports several asynchronous patterns to handle non-blocking operations. The main ones are:

    1.Callbacks — the traditional approach, simple but can lead to ‘callback hell’ if nested.
    2.Promises — provide a cleaner chainable syntax for async operations and better error handling.
    3.Async/Await — built on promises, allows writing asynchronous code in a synchronous style, improving readability.
    4.Event Emitters / Streams — for handling asynchronous events or streaming data.
    5.Observables / Reactive patterns (RxJS) — for complex async data streams and composition.

    Choosing the right pattern depends on readability, error handling, and control over concurrency,
    especially in high-performance Node applications.”

  ===========================================================================

  6.Error Handling Design — short answer

    “In Node.js, robust error handling is critical because unhandled errors can crash the process. Best practices include:

    1.Centralized error handling — using middleware (Express/NestJS) to catch errors and return consistent responses.
    2.Async errors — always handle promise rejections (.catch) or use try/catch with async/await.
    3.Operational vs Programmer errors — operational errors (like network or DB failures) should be handled gracefully;
      programmer errors (bugs) should fail fast.
    4.Logging and monitoring — capture stack traces, context, and alerts using tools like Winston, Sentry, or Datadog.
    5.Fail-safe design — validate inputs, use timeouts, circuit breakers, and retries for external services.

    In production, I combine structured error classes, global exception filters (NestJS),
    and logging/metrics to maintain reliability and observability.”

  7.PostgreSQL Indexing — short answer

    “Indexes in PostgreSQL are used to speed up data retrieval by avoiding full table scans. The common types are:

   1. B-Tree — default, great for equality and range queries.
   2. Hash — for equality checks, less commonly used.
   3. GIN (Generalized Inverted Index) — for full-text search, JSONB, and array columns.
   4. GiST — for geometric data types and full-text search.
   5. BRIN — for very large, sequential datasets like time series.

    As a senior engineer, I also consider:

    -Index selectivity and cardinality.
    -Partial indexes for filtering subsets of data.
    -Covering indexes to include additional columns for faster queries.
    -Avoid over-indexing, as inserts/updates become slower.

    Proper indexing is critical for performance, query planning, and scaling high-traffic applications.”

  ===========================================================================

  8.Query Optimization — short answer

    “Query optimization in PostgreSQL involves writing queries and designing schemas so the database can execute them
    efficiently.
    Key strategies include:

    1. Use proper indexes — B-Tree, GIN, or BRIN depending on the query.
    2. **Avoid SELECT *** — select only necessary columns.
    3. Analyze query plans — use EXPLAIN or EXPLAIN ANALYZE to find bottlenecks.
    4. Use JOINs and WHERE clauses efficiently — filter early and avoid unnecessary joins.
    5. Batch inserts/updates — instead of row-by-row operations.
    6. Leverage caching — Redis or in-memory caches for frequently accessed data.
    7. Partitioning — for very large tables to reduce scan time.

    In production, I combine indexing, query rewriting, caching, and monitoring to ensure high throughput and low
    latency for PostgreSQL queries.”

  ===========================================================================

  9.Transactions — short answer

    “A transaction is a sequence of database operations executed as a single unit of work.
    PostgreSQL transactions ensure ACID properties — Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.
    In Node.js, we use transactions via client libraries (like pg or TypeORM/NestJS) to wrap multiple queries so that
    either all succeed or all roll back on failure.

    Key points I emphasize as a senior engineer:

    1. BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK — basic transaction control.
    2. Isolation levels — READ COMMITTED, REPEATABLE READ, SERIALIZABLE to balance concurrency vs consistency.
    3. Error handling — always rollback on failure to avoid partial updates.
    4. Minimize transaction scope — keep them short to reduce locks and avoid blocking the event loop.
    5. Use connection pooling carefully, ensuring transactions stay on the same client connection.

    Proper transaction management prevents data corruption, ensures consistency, and is critical in financial
    or multi-step operations.”

  ===========================================================================

  10.Isolation Levels — short answer

     “PostgreSQL supports four main transaction isolation levels, which control visibility of data changes between
     concurrent transactions:

     1. Read Uncommitted — theoretically allows dirty reads, but in PostgreSQL it behaves like Read Committed.
     2. Read Committed (default) — a transaction sees only data committed before each query; prevents dirty reads
        but allows non-repeatable reads and phantom reads.
     3. Repeatable Read — a transaction sees a consistent snapshot of data at the start; prevents dirty and
        non-repeatable reads, but phantom inserts may occur.
     4. Serializable — strictest; transactions behave as if executed sequentially; prevents all anomalies but
        can cause serialization failures that require retrying transactions.

     As a senior engineer, I choose the isolation level based on the consistency vs concurrency tradeoff. For example,
     financial transactions often use Serializable or Repeatable Read, while reporting queries may use Read Committed
     for higher throughput.”

1.Queues — Short Senior-Level Explanation

  “A queue is an asynchronous communication mechanism that decouples producers from consumers. Instead of processing
  heavy or time-consuming tasks in the request cycle, I push a message into a queue, and background workers consume it
  independently. This improves performance, fault-tolerance, and system scalability.”

   ===========================================================================

2.Rate Limiting — Short Senior-Level Explanation

  “Rate limiting is a technique to control how many requests a user or client can make within a specific time window.
   It protects the system from abuse, DoS attacks, brute-force attempts, and ensures fair resource usage.”

   ===========================================================================

3.Idempotency — Short Senior-Level Explanation

  “Idempotency means that performing the same operation multiple times produces the same result. It prevents duplicate
  side effects, especially in payments, orders, and external API calls.”

x.RabbitMQ vs Kafka — Short Senior-Level Explanation for Interview
  🔥 High-level difference

  RabbitMQ is a message broker (for real-time tasks). Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform
  (for high-throughput logs and long-term storage).

  ----------------------------------------------------------

  “I use RabbitMQ when I need reliable message delivery, routing patterns, delayed or priority queues,
  or when microservices need to offload tasks like emails, notifications, or WebSocket broadcasting.
  I use Kafka when I need high-throughput event streaming, replayability, and long-term retention—like analytics
  pipelines, event sourcing, log aggregation, or processing millions of events per second. RabbitMQ is task-oriented;
  Kafka is event-stream-oriented.”
