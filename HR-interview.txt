1.Why should we hire you? — Strong Senior Engineer Answer

Shorter Version (for HR round)

You should hire me because I bring deep backend expertise and a strong ownership mentality. I’ve spent the last 7–8 years focused on building scalable, reliable, production-level backend systems with Node.js, NestJS, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, Redis, and other technologies. I can take a feature from idea to production independently, solve complex technical problems, and help the team move faster with clean, maintainable code. I’m confident I can bring real value to your engineering team.


2.Why are you leaving your current job?

My current role has been valuable, but the opportunities for growth and technical advancement have become limited. I’m looking for a place where I can make a bigger impact, work with modern technologies, and be involved in projects that push me to become a better engineer.

3.What motivates you?

I'm motivated by solving complex problems, delivering production-quality features, and continuously improving my skills. I enjoy seeing my work make a real impact on the product and the team.


4.How do you handle stress and pressure?

I’ve learned that pressure is part of engineering. I handle it by staying calm, keeping a clear priority list, and making sure communication with the team is transparent. This helps me make the right decisions quickly without sacrificing stability or quality.


5.Tell me about a conflict in your team and how you handled it.

In one of my previous projects, we had a conflict between two backend developers regarding the architectural approach for a new microservice. One wanted to use a fully event-driven pattern with RabbitMQ, while the other preferred a simpler REST-based design because of time constraints. The disagreement was slowing down progress and creating tension in the team."

"As the senior engineer / team lead, I scheduled a short technical discussion where each person could present their reasoning with facts — performance implications, complexity, scalability, and delivery deadlines. My goal wasn’t to choose sides but to make the discussion objective and aligned with the product goals."

"After reviewing the arguments, I highlighted that while event-driven architecture is more scalable, the current requirements didn’t justify the added complexity. So we agreed to start with a REST-based structure with the option to extend to RabbitMQ events later as the system grows.


6.How do you prioritize tasks?

As a backend engineer, I prioritize tasks using a mix of business impact, system dependencies, and technical complexity. My approach looks like this

If there are issues affecting uptime, API performance, security, or data integrity, those immediately become top priority. A stable backend is always more important than new features.
